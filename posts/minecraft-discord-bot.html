              2020 has not been especially *ahem* bright for the most part. Very much has gone wrong, and very much continues to go worse. But I found a bit of solace after setting up Discord server for some of my friends and I.
            </p>

              If you're unfamiliar, <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> is a essentially a big chat room-- like Slack or Microsoft Teams or GroupMe-- but geared towards gamers. Communication is organized around "servers", which have any number of "channels" for specific topics, including voice channels, which you join with any microphone equipped device. These voice channels are great for the pandemic era; I've used them for gaming, hosting virtual movie nights, and just catching up.
            </p>
            <p>
              So Discord ended up being the perfect place to stay up to date without the very linear expectations of a group chat. And although the majority of the members of our server weren't gamers, we spent a lot of time gaming together. Specifically, playing Minecraft.
            </p>
            <p>
              Minecraft was the perfect game for us mainly due to how simple it was. Its simple controls were great, since many of us don't often game and can't be expected to keep up with anything hardcore; its system requirements are fairly minimal, which was essential since only a few of us were playing on anything other than standard laptops; but mostly, the rules of the game are perfectly relaxed. You're not really expected do anything other than make a nice house and... make it nicer. 
            </p>
            <p>
              What's less simple, however, is playing Minecraft together. There's no centralized online infrastructure like you get when you play Call Of Duty or something. The game is stubbornly offline and single-player (that has started to change since Microsoft bought Minecraft, but it remains pretty well entrenched).
            </p>
            <p>
              It's totally possible to play online in a shared game, of course. As long as you're hosting the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Minecraft provides <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server">server software</a> that can create a networked world. Unless you've got a fairly good grip on ip networking and os fundamentals, this is pretty tough stuff. Luckily, I spend four years learning studying it! It's out of the scope of this post, but setting up a custom Minecraft server involved opening a port on my home router's firewall, and forwarding that port to my PC (named Marilyn ❤️) which runs the server software. Anyone that wanted to play on my server would open a direct connection to my router's public ipv4 address.
            </p>
            <p>
              This worked great-- for quite a while! Friends from across the country came together to build our own little world. But the setup was not without its drawbacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the members of our server live on the East coast, while I (and more importantly, Marilyn) live in California. Everyone except for me had fairly poor connection to the server. Most of the time we didn't notice it-- but it reared its head at intensive moments, like the initial logging in to the server and establishing the connection. But more importantly-- I had to manually start and stop the server when we wanted to play. And I couldn't always be around when the desire to play struck! I was suddenly feeling the pressures of a network admin, albeit one with low responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              But hold on, I didn't need to suffer this fate, we're living in the future! All I needed was a computer that I didn't have to worry about to run our server, and what is the Cloud but networked computers! Time to put that computer science degree to use, Rodgers.
