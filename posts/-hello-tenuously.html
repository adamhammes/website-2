          <h1>Hello, tenuously</h1>
          <div>
            <p>
              To be perfectly honest, I'm not so sure what my goals are here.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a software developer (currently). I am 24 (currently). I live in Los Angeles (curren-- you get the idea).
            </p>
            <p>
              What I am not is an authority. On-- well, on anything. I'm only barely out of my childhood, not even two years into my career in software, and I have no education nor experience in writing anything beyond penning a few spec screenplays (but nobody's perfect).
            </p>
            <p>
              But despite this lack of authority, here I am. On the homepage of this site, I note that I am "aiming towards unfinished". This is no mantra; I don't have this on my wall in script next to my "Live Laugh Love" poster and venture capitalist self-help book.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, this aim is quite contradictory to me, and I like that about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because on one hand, it aligns to that certain silicon valley, rockstar developer, 10x, builder mindset bullshit-- with which I do align frequently. To never be finished learning, to always be looking for new answers to new questions and to avoid complacency at all costs. Through a combination of many things (chief among them priviledge, surely) I have the rare ability freely gain new knowledge, develop new skills, embrace new experiences. To kill the engine when I'm comfortable is embarassing and maybe inexcusable.
            </p>
            <p>
              And on the other hand, this aim towards unfinished is an aim towards failure. At its most obvious, there's no hope for mastery when you're always reaching to something new. But I want to take it further. I want the freedom to abandon my goals when I lose interest, to give up. I've paid for domain names for apps I never built, sketched outlines for stories I never wrote, poured myself into letters for friends that I never worked up the courage to send. These failures aren't losses, not even in the "now I know not to make these mistakes again" sort of way. An attempt and its abandonment: a decision, possibly fueled by previous failures, and its own failure. That's not the origin story for my final achievement, that's the core of it all! That's me! What a poor way to be defined, solely by my achievements, and my failures only in negation. They're one and the same, neither weighs more.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Aiming towards unfinished". It's pithy, it's cute, it's been dissected into grand meaning. It's the sort of thing I would definitely reject as inauthentic. I do not disagree, nor am I really sure that I really agree with my analysis above. So I cling to this second definition: that I am unfinished with all this posturing and meaning. I make no guarantees that I won't simply abandon this entire premise; declaring that it was pretentious, examined too emphatically. But for now, I hedge my bets with the first definition, I reach to something new.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, why? What's the deal, what are these posts going to be about? Probably, they'll be about me. Not exclusively, and probably not completely honestly. I know there are many things I'd like to write about in regards to software, even if just practically (I forsee a "How to integrate touch-based interactions and animations in React" in the near future). Politics? Absolutely fair game. Personal stories, a digital diary? If I'm brave enough. I'd eventually like to post short stories here, but that's a far way aways. Maybe these posts will just be fervent gushing about the latest movie/album/book that I'm excited about.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, tenuously, I say hello. I make no promises about a schedule, focus, or even quality. This is, and I find no shame in being, unfinished.
