Gonna be a quick one here, because it's 85 degrees inside my apartment so I feel like a slug.

Next weekend I go to Chicago to visit a friend, and I'm very excited. I've never visited, and I had quite a few friends go to school there that I neglected.

Only really interesting thing I watched this week was Let Them All Talk, a Soderbergh movie set on a cruise. It was shot over a week and mostly improvised, and because of that it feels very loose and almost jazz-like. It almost approached mumble-core level stuff, but for some reason I can't articulate, it never quite makes it there.

I love Soderbergh's flexibility like this. This is a totally different production than Ocean's Eleven, which is a totally different production than Che, etc etc. You get the sense that there's very little of the overbearing particular director stereotype in him.

David Ehrlich wrote [a review](https://www.indiewire.com/2020/12/let-them-all-talk-review-steven-soderbergh-1234601900/) of the film that seems to articulate the rare-ness of his flexibility, although I'm not sure I agree with the conclusion that a Fincher could've made this movie better.

I think that's it for this week! Finally getting down to the brevity that I was going for when I started these logs.

Only thing to close out with is this month's episode of [CoRecursive](https://corecursive.com/066-sqlite-with-richard-hipp/), this time with Richard Hipp, the creator of SQLite. It's clear from his prior work (working on systems software for NAVY BATTLESHIPS??) that he's a special type of programmer, but it's great to hear about starting what is now such a ubiquitous a project from scratch.
